# Bushi Framework - Build Shit Fast

A comprehensive framework for solo developers/entrepreneurs to build micro-SaaS and indie hacking businesses.

## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## How It Works

- **`/ps`** → Product Strategist (business strategy, market analysis)
- **`/pd`** → Product Designer (UX/UI, user research)  
- **`/pb`** → Product Builder (technical architecture, development)
- **`/gh`** → Growth Hacker (marketing, customer acquisition)
- **`/bo`** → Business Operations (financial, legal, operations)

## Philosophy

Build Shit Fast. No overthinking, no role-switching overhead, just focused expertise when you need it.
