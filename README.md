# 🚀 Bushi Framework
## Build Shit Fast
> A comprehensive framework for solo developers/entrepreneurs to build micro-SaaS and indie hacking businesses.


## 🎯 **Philosophy**

**Build Shit Fast** - No overthinking, no role-switching overhead, just focused expertise when you need it.


## 🚀 **Quick Start**

**Get Bushi Framework running in your project in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Initialize Bushi Framework:**
   ```bash
   npx bushi@latest init
   ```

3. **Open in Cursor IDE and start building:**
   - **New user?** Run `/bushi-start` to preview available agents
   - **Know what you need?** Use commands like `/ba`, `/dx`, `/ta`, etc.

**Note:** Using `@latest` ensures you get the most recent version.


## ✨ **What Makes Bushi Special**

- 🚀 **Instant Activation** - Commands like `/ba` activate specialized expertise
- 🎯 **Deep Focus** - Each agent has deep knowledge in their domain  
- 🧠 **Smart Context** - Agents understand your project and goals
- ⚡ **No Overhead** - Eliminates role-switching mental friction


## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Currently only works with Cursor IDE** - The framework uses Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to detect and activate the different agent roles.

**Node.js:** Requires Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher. For optimal ES Module compatibility, Node.js 20.0.0+ is recommended.
