## 🚀 Quick Installation

   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Initialize Bushi Framework:**
   ```bash
   npx bushi init
   ```

## ✨ What Makes Bushi Special

- 🚀 **Instant Activation** - Commands like `/ps` activate specialized expertise
- 🎯 **Deep Focus** - Each agent has deep knowledge in their domain  
- 🧠 **Smart Context** - Agents understand your project and goals
- ⚡ **No Overhead** - Eliminates role-switching mental friction

## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Currently only works with Cursor IDE** - The framework uses Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to detect and activate the different agent roles.
