# 🚀 Bushi Framework
## Build Shit Fast
> A comprehensive framework for solo developers/entrepreneurs to build micro-SaaS and indie hacking businesses.


## 🎯 **Philosophy**

**Build Shit Fast** - No overthinking, no role-switching overhead, just focused expertise when you need it.


## 🚀 Quick Start

**Get Bushi Framework running in your project in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Install & Initialize Bushi Framework:**
   ```bash
   npx bushi@latest init
   ```

2. **Open in Cursor IDE and start building!**

### 🛠️ **Available Commands**

- `bushi cleanup` - Remove Bushi Framework completely
- `bushi info` - Show framework information and version

### 🔄 **Updating Bushi Framework**

To update to the latest version:
```bash
npx bushi@latest init
```

The update process automatically handles existing installations without creating duplicates.


## ✨ **What Makes Bushi Special**

- 🚀 **Instant Activation** - Commands like `/ba` activate specialized expertise
- 🎯 **Deep Focus** - Each agent has deep knowledge in their domain  
- 🧠 **Smart Context** - Agents understand your project and goals
- ⚡ **No Overhead** - Eliminates role-switching mental friction
- 📋 **Automatic Progress Tracking** - Documentation stays synchronized automatically
- 🔄 **Smart Updates** - Agents automatically update roadmaps and track completion


## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Currently only works with Cursor IDE** - The framework uses Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to detect and activate the different agent roles.

**Node.js:** Requires Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher. For optimal ES Module compatibility, Node.js 20.0.0+ is recommended.

## 🆕 **New in v0.5.3: Critical Framework Stability Fixes**

### 🚨 **Framework Rule Enforcement**
Bushi Framework now enforces proper workflow and prevents critical bypasses:

- **Workflow Validation**: Bushi Start now enforces proper agent sequence (BA → DX → TA → GS → BO)
- **Context Reading**: Agents must check project documentation before proceeding
- **Business First**: New ideas must start with Business Architect, not Technical Architect
- **Documentation Requirements**: Proper project foundation required before technical work

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed**
- **Agent Routing**: Bushi Start no longer bypasses proper workflow sequence
- **Context Bypass**: Agents can no longer proceed without reading project documentation
- **Workflow Violations**: System now enforces business validation before technical work
- **Agent Names**: Corrected agent command references in onboarding

### 🎯 **What This Means for You**
