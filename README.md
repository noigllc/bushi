## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Currently only works with Cursor IDE** - The framework uses Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to detect and activate the different agent roles.
