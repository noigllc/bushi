## 🚀 Quick Start

**Get Bushi Framework running in your project in 3 simple steps:**

1. **Install Bushi Framework:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g bushi
   ```

2. **Initialize Bushi Framework:**

## ✨ **What Makes Bushi Special**

- 🚀 **Instant Activation** - Commands like `/ba` activate specialized expertise
- 🎯 **Deep Focus** - Each agent has deep knowledge in their domain  
- 🧠 **Smart Context** - Agents understand your project and goals
- ⚡ **No Overhead** - Eliminates role-switching mental friction
- 📋 **Automatic Progress Tracking** - Documentation stays synchronized automatically
- 🔄 **Smart Updates** - Agents automatically update roadmaps and track completion


## What It Is

Bushi Framework is a set of "mental roles" that can be activated when needed, eliminating the overhead of role-switching for solo founders. Think of it as having a team of experts in your head that you can activate with simple commands.

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Currently only works with Cursor IDE** - The framework uses Cursor rules (`.mdc` files) to detect and activate the different agent roles.

**Node.js:** Requires Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher. For optimal ES Module compatibility, Node.js 20.0.0+ is recommended.
