## Framework Architecture

### How Cursor Rules Actually Work:
Based on Cursor documentation, rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` directory and use **MDC format** (`.mdc` files) with metadata.

**Rule Types:**
- **Always** - Always included in model context
- **Auto Attached** - Included when files matching glob patterns are referenced
- **Agent Requested** - AI decides whether to include based on description
- **Manual** - Only included when explicitly mentioned using `@ruleName`

### File Structure for Projects:
1. **`.cursor/rules/`** - Project rules (version-controlled, scoped to codebase)
2. **`.cursorrules`** - Legacy format (deprecated, but still supported)

### Command System Implementation:
The `/ps` commands would work by:
1. **Manual Rules** - You reference them with `@bushi-start` 
2. **Always Rules** - Automatically included in every conversation
3. **Custom Commands** - Would need to be implemented as Cursor extensions or custom rules

### Recommended Implementation Approach:
**Chosen Architecture:**
- **`.cursor/rules/bushi.mdc`** - Always rule that intercepts commands and routes to role logic
- **`.bushi/` folder** - Hidden folder containing role-specific logic files
- **Command system** - `/ps`, `/pd`, etc. trigger role activation

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation between Cursor rules and framework logic
- Easy to maintain and update framework independently
- Professional appearance with hidden framework folder
- Scalable architecture for adding new roles

### NPX Package Approach:
**For Distribution & Reusability:**
- Create `npx bushi init` command
- Generates `.cursor/rules/` directory with all framework rules
- Allows other creators to easily install the framework
- Can include project templates and examples
- Updates can be distributed through npm

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NPX Command Requirements:
**Critical:** The NPX command must generate files with correct metadata positioning
**Problem:** If metadata is malformed, users will get broken rules that don't work
**Solution:** 
1. Use template files with pre-written metadata instead of dynamic generation
2. Test file generation process thoroughly before distribution
3. Include validation step to ensure metadata is correctly positioned
4. Consider using a different file creation method that preserves metadata structure

**Package Structure:**
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bushi-start.mdc
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product-designer.mdc

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-structure/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

### Pattern Discovery & Project Tracking:
**Project Tracking Files:**
- Each project gets a `project-tracking.md` file
- Records: tech stack, business model, challenges, outcomes
- Can be exported/aggregated for pattern analysis

**Pattern Discovery Process:**
1. **Individual Project Tracking** - Document each project's journey
2. **Aggregation** - Collect data from multiple projects
3. **Analysis** - Identify common patterns, successful strategies
4. **Framework Evolution** - Update rules based on learnings

**Example Tracking Fields:**
- Project type (B2B/B2C, industry, geography)
- Tech stack and architecture decisions
- Business model and monetization approach
- Key challenges and solutions
- Launch strategy and results
- Lessons learned and recommendations

### How Commands Work:
The framework rules include patterns that recognize commands and activate the appropriate role mindset:

### Command Recognition Patterns:
```
When user types "/ps", activate Product Strategist thinking:
- Focus on business strategy, market analysis, MVP definition
- Ask strategic questions about viability, pricing, competition
- Provide business-focused guidance and frameworks
```

### Help Command System:
The framework includes two help commands to assist users:

**`/commands` - Quick Reference:**
- Lists all available commands with brief descriptions
- Provides quick access to command overview
- Helps users remember which command to use

**`/help` - Framework Overview:**
- Comprehensive explanation of the Bushi Framework
- Philosophy and benefits of the role-based approach
- Usage examples and best practices
- Framework structure and how to get the most out of it

### Command Documentation Standards:
Each command should have:
- Clear description of what it does
- Examples of when to use it
- Expected outcomes and behaviors
- Related commands for similar tasks

### üö® **Critical Workflow Enforcement - bushi-start Command**
**The `/bushi-start` command now enforces automatic routing to Business Architect agent:**
- **When users describe ideas**: Automatically activates `/ba` agent for business validation
- **When users ask about agents**: Provides agent overview and selection guidance
- **NEVER bypasses business validation** for new ideas/projects
- **ALWAYS starts with PRD and roadmap creation** for new concepts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Note:
**The `bushi.mdc` file MUST have `alwaysApply: true` in the metadata for the command system to work.**
- This was manually fixed by the user after initial creation
- The file creation process needs to ensure this metadata is properly set
- Without `alwaysApply: true`, the rule won't be active and commands won't work

### üîç Metadata Issue Analysis:
**Problem Identified:** When using `edit_file` tool, metadata is sometimes added at the end of files instead of the beginning
**Root Cause:** The tool may be interpreting the file structure incorrectly or adding metadata in the wrong location
**Impact:** This could cause NPX command to generate broken files that need manual fixing
**Solution:** Need to verify file creation process and ensure metadata is properly positioned

### How to Use:
1. **Activate the appropriate role** using commands like `/ps`
2. **Use role-specific prompts** to get into the right mindset
3. **Combine roles** when needed (e.g., Product Strategist + Product Builder for MVP planning)
4. **Iterate and refine** each role based on experience and learnings

### Example Prompts:
- **Product Strategist**: "I have an idea for [X]. Help me validate this by analyzing the market, identifying competitors, and suggesting a business model."
- **Product Designer**: "I need to design the user flow for [feature]. Help me create wireframes and think through the user experience."
- **Product Builder**: "I'm planning to build [feature]. Help me break this down into sprints, choose the tech stack, and plan the architecture."
- **Growth Hacker**: "I'm ready to launch [product]. Help me create a go-to-market strategy and identify the best marketing channels."
- **Business Operations**: "I need to set up the business side of [product]. Help me with financial planning, legal basics, and tool selection."

## Framework Principles & Anti-Assumption Rules

### Core Principles:

1. **Always Seek Understanding First**
   - Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions
   - Confirm user intent before proceeding
   - Explain what you're doing and why
   - Wait for approval before implementing major changes

2. **Documentation Over Assumption**
   - Document what users actually ask for
   - Provide explanations before implementations
   - Create clear command documentation
   - Build understanding incrementally

3. **User Control and Transparency**
   - Users decide what gets built
   - Clear communication about changes
   - No hidden or assumed functionality
   - Framework serves user needs, not developer preferences

### üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE (MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION)

**Before ANY technical discussion or planning, agents MUST:**
1. **Automatically check** existing project documentation for project context
2. **Review files**: README.md, POSSIBLE_FEATURES.md, CHANGELOG.md, and other project docs
3. **If context clear**: "I've reviewed your project documentation. Let me understand your current needs..."
4. **If context unclear**: "I need to understand your project better. Let me ask a few questions..."
5. **NEVER proceed** with technical work until project context is established

**Documentation Review Process:**
- **Agent scans** existing project files for context
- **Agent identifies** what's already documented and what's missing
- **Agent asks targeted questions** to fill any knowledge gaps
- **Agent establishes** clear understanding before technical planning
- **User review**: Agent confirms understanding before proceeding

### Anti-Assumption Framework Rules:

**Before Implementing Any Feature:**
1. **Ask:** "Is this what you actually want me to build?"
2. **Explain:** "Here's what I'm planning to do and why"
3. **Confirm:** "Should I proceed with this approach?"
4. **Document:** "This feature was requested by the user for [specific reason]"

**When Adding New Commands:**
1. **Verify:** "You want me to add [command] for [specific purpose]?"
2. **Clarify:** "What should this command do exactly?"
3. **Test:** "Let me show you what this would look like first"
4. **Implement:** Only after explicit approval

**Framework Development Process:**
1. **User Request** ‚Üí Document the exact request
2. **Understanding** ‚Üí Ask clarifying questions
3. **Proposal** ‚Üí Explain what you plan to build
4. **Approval** ‚Üí Wait for user confirmation
5. **Implementation** ‚Üí Build exactly what was approved
6. **Documentation** ‚Üí Record what was built and why
