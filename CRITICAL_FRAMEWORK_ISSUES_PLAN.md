# Critical Framework Issues - Recovery & Fix Plan

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Missing Core Documentation Files**
- **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document (DELETED)
- **roadmap.md** - Development Roadmap (DELETED) 
- **bushi-framework.md** - Project Context (DELETED)
- **Other critical docs** - Multiple framework files deleted

### **2. Framework Rule Enforcement Failures**
- **Agent Bypass**: Bushi Start ignored proper workflow, jumped straight to TA
- **Missing Context Reading**: No documentation check before proceeding
- **Workflow Violation**: Skipped foundational business validation (BA should have been first)
- **Premature Technical Discussion**: TA started architecture talk without business context
- **No Documentation Foundation**: Missing PRD and roadmap with no attempt to create them

### **3. Root Causes**
- Rules are descriptive but not enforced
- No automatic validation checkpoints
- Agents can bypass mandatory behavioral rules
- System lacks built-in workflow enforcement

## **üîç PHASE 2 FINDINGS - Rule Enforcement Analysis**

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Individual agents** have proper behavioral rules (BA, TA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Agent rules** include mandatory context reading and validation
- ‚ùå **Bushi Start agent** has outdated agent names and no rule enforcement
- ‚ùå **Main framework rules** are descriptive but lack automatic enforcement
- ‚ùå **No pre-action validation** hooks in the system
- ‚ùå **Agent selection logic** can bypass proper workflow

### **Specific Violation Points Identified:**
1. **Bushi Start Agent** (`bushi-start.mdc`):
   - References non-existent agents (`/pd`, `/pb`, `/gh`)
   - No mandatory context reading before agent selection
   - No workflow validation or rule enforcement
   - Can proceed without checking project documentation

2. **Framework Rules** (`bushi-framework.md`):
   - Rules are descriptive but not automatically enforced
   - No validation checkpoints before agent activation
   - No blocking of non-compliant actions
   - Agents can be activated without proper context

3. **Missing Enforcement Mechanisms**:
   - No pre-action validation hooks
   - No mandatory workflow step enforcement
   - No automatic blocking of non-compliant actions
   - No built-in documentation requirements

## üîÑ **RECOVERY PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Restore Critical Files (IMMEDIATE)**
- [x] Identify deleted files from git history
- [x] Recover PRD.md from commit 3ad30b2~1
- [x] Recover roadmap.md from commit 3ad30b2~1  
- [x] Recover bushi-framework.md from commit 3ad30b2~1
- [x] Restore all files to .bushi/docs/project-context/
- [x] Restore project-summary.md file
- [x] Verify no current files are lost in restoration

### **Phase 2: Fix Framework Rule Enforcement (IN PROGRESS)**
- [x] Audit current agent rule files for enforcement mechanisms
- [x] Identify where rules can be bypassed
- [x] Document specific violation points
- [x] Map current agent selection logic
- [x] Identify where proper routing fails

### **Phase 3: Implement Rule Enforcement (IN PROGRESS)**
- [x] Fix bushi-start.mdc agent names and add rule enforcement
- [x] Add mandatory context reading to bushi-start
- [x] Add mandatory workflow validation to bushi-start
- [x] Add mandatory documentation checks to bushi-start
- [ ] Add automatic validation checkpoints to main framework
- [ ] Implement pre-action validation hooks
- [ ] Create mandatory documentation checks
- [ ] Build workflow step enforcement
- [ ] Add automatic blocking of non-compliant actions

### **Phase 4: Test & Validate**
- [ ] Test rule enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Verify agents cannot bypass rules
- [ ] Test workflow enforcement
- [ ] Validate documentation requirements
- [ ] User experience testing

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

1. **Restore deleted core files** from git history
2. **Integrate critical issues** into roadmap.md
3. **Create enforcement mechanisms** for framework rules
4. **Test agent workflows** with proper context reading

## üìã **NEXT STEPS**

1. **File Recovery**: Restore all deleted documentation files
2. **Issue Integration**: Add critical issues to roadmap
3. **Rule Analysis**: Audit current agent rules for enforcement gaps
4. **Implementation**: Build automatic rule enforcement system
