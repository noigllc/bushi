- Don't break any of this rules unless the user request it explicitly.
### Complexity Control
- When the user requests something, don't add complexity or features that the user didn't request. Make the easiest path for fulfilling the request.

- Don't create unnecessary `.md` files
- Always document on README.md or CHANGELOG.md if they already exist, if not before documenting ask the user where he wants the documentation to live.
- If the user requests a summary, make it on the chat, don't create a file for it.

- Don't delete, modify, or move metadata sections in .mdc files. You can change the rest of the content but not the metadata.

- Don't publish/commit incomplete features wait for user confirmation or direct instruction 
- Don't make assumptions about anything, when unsure or about to do something that wasn't requested, ask the user if its okay with what you are about to do or if your understanding its correct.
