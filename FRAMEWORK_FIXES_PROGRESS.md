# Bushi Framework Fixes - Progress Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 1: File Recovery**
- [x] **Recovered deleted core documentation files** from git history
- [x] **Restored PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document
- [x] **Restored roadmap.md** - Development Roadmap with critical issues
- [x] **Restored bushi-framework.md** - Project Context
- [x] **Restored project-summary.md** - Core project overview
- [x] **Verified no current files were lost** in restoration process

### âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 2: Rule Enforcement Analysis**
- [x] **Audited current agent rule files** for enforcement mechanisms
- [x] **Identified where rules can be bypassed** - Found 3 major violation points
- [x] **Documented specific violation points** in bushi-start.mdc and main framework
- [x] **Mapped current agent selection logic** and identified routing failures
- [x] **Analyzed individual agent rules** - Found they have proper behavioral constraints

### âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 3: Initial Rule Enforcement Implementation**
- [x] **Fixed bushi-start.mdc agent names** - Updated from `/pd`, `/pb`, `/gh` to `/dx`, `/ta`, `/gs`
- [x] **Added mandatory context reading** to bushi-start agent
- [x] **Added mandatory workflow validation** to prevent bypassing BA for new ideas
- [x] **Added mandatory documentation checks** before agent selection
- [x] **Implemented proper workflow sequence** enforcement in bushi-start

## ðŸš¨ **REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### **Phase 3: Complete Rule Enforcement (IN PROGRESS)**
- [ ] **Add automatic validation checkpoints** to main framework rules
- [ ] **Implement pre-action validation hooks** for all agent activations
- [ ] **Create mandatory documentation checks** at framework level
- [ ] **Build workflow step enforcement** that cannot be bypassed
- [ ] **Add automatic blocking** of non-compliant actions

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
- [ ] **Test rule enforcement mechanisms** with real agent activations
- [ ] **Verify agents cannot bypass rules** in any scenario
- [ ] **Test workflow enforcement** with proper context reading
- [ ] **Validate documentation requirements** are enforced
- [ ] **User experience testing** to ensure proper workflow

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`.bushi/bushi-start.mdc`** âœ… **FIXED**
   - Updated agent names to match actual agents
   - Added mandatory behavioral rules
   - Added workflow validation
   - Added context reading requirements

2. **`.bushi/docs/project-context/`** âœ… **RESTORED**
   - `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
   - `roadmap.md` - Development Roadmap
   - `bushi-framework.md` - Project Context

3. **`.bushi/docs/project-summary.md`** âœ… **RESTORED**

### **Files Requiring Updates:**
1. **`bushi-framework.md`** - Add automatic rule enforcement
2. **Main framework rules** - Implement validation checkpoints
3. **Agent activation system** - Add pre-action validation hooks

## ðŸ“‹ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Next Session):**
1. **Implement automatic validation checkpoints** in main framework
2. **Add pre-action validation hooks** for agent activations
3. **Create mandatory workflow enforcement** at system level

### **Short Term:**
1. **Test rule enforcement** with real agent activations
2. **Validate workflow sequence** cannot be bypassed
3. **Ensure documentation requirements** are enforced

### **Medium Term:**
1. **User testing** of new enforcement mechanisms
2. **Performance optimization** of validation system
3. **Documentation updates** for new workflow requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- [x] **Core documentation files restored** and accessible
- [x] **Bushi Start agent fixed** with proper workflow enforcement
- [x] **Agent names corrected** to match actual implementation
- [ ] **Framework rules automatically enforced** (cannot be bypassed)
- [ ] **Workflow sequence mandatory** (BA â†’ DX â†’ TA â†’ GS â†’ BO)
- [ ] **Context reading required** before any agent action
- [ ] **Documentation creation enforced** for new projects
