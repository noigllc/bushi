# Bushi Framework - Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ **PRIORITY MATRIX: High Impact + Low Difficulty First**

### **ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY - High Impact, Low Difficulty (IMMEDIATE)**
**Goal**: Fix fundamental workflow violations with minimal effort for maximum impact

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- [x] BA not asking about existing roadmap/PRD files before proceeding
- [x] BA adding timeframes without user input
- [x] BA creating MVP plans from vague ideas without proper context gathering
- [x] TA implementing without discussing tech stack or requesting user input
- [x] TA not expecting or requesting project documentation (PRD/roadmap)
- [x] TA not providing explanations of actions or requesting user feedback
- [x] TA working in isolation instead of suggesting other agents
- [x] Bushi-Limits file not being distributed to users (alwaysApply: true)
- [x] CLI not copying bushi-limits.mdc to user projects during init

**NEW CRITICAL ISSUES FROM USER FEEDBACK**:
- [x] **CRITICAL**: BA agent tries to move to TA without creating PRD/roadmap - **MUST ALWAYS create PRD/roadmap first**
- [x] **CRITICAL**: All other agents should request user goes back to BA if PRD/roadmap missing
- [x] **CRITICAL**: PRD should always be called just `prd` (no project-specific suffixes)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Files should be created in `./bushi/docs` folder (prd, roadmap, backlog)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: README should always be in root folder, not in bushi folders
- [x] **CRITICAL**: TA agent needs clear ES6+ and TypeScript implementation standards
- [x] **CRITICAL**: TA goes "full blast" instead of step-by-step implementation
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Agents over-engineer A LOT - need simplicity rules
- [x] **CRITICAL**: No user confirmation between implementation phases
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Missing chat continuation guidance for new chats
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Framework commands not working due to missing metadata - **FIXED**
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Metadata protection system implemented - **MULTIPLE SAFEGUARDS ADDED**

**Technical Fixes Required**:
- [x] Implement mandatory context reading before agent actions
- [x] Add user input validation and feedback loops
- [x] Create agent collaboration protocols and handoff suggestions
- [x] Build proper workflow validation and documentation requirements
- [x] Distribute Bushi-Limits file to all users with alwaysApply enabled
- [x] Add behavioral constraints to prevent premature implementation
- [x] **REFINED**: Intelligent handling of "no existing documentation" cases
- [x] Fix CLI to copy bushi-limits.mdc during init command
- [x] **NEW**: Fix bushi-start.mdc agent names and workflow enforcement
- [x] **NEW**: Add mandatory context reading to bushi-start
- [x] **NEW**: Add mandatory workflow validation to bushi-start
- [ ] **NEW**: Implement automatic rule enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] **NEW**: Add pre-action validation hooks
- [ ] **NEW**: Create mandatory workflow step enforcement
- [ ] **NEW**: Build automatic blocking of non-compliant actions

### **âš¡ HIGH PRIORITY - High Impact, Medium Difficulty**
**Goal**: Fix major workflow issues that require moderate effort but have high impact**

**BA Agent Workflow Fixes**:
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: BA MUST create PRD/roadmap before suggesting other agents
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: BA MUST never suggest moving to other agents without foundational docs
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: All other agents MUST redirect to BA if PRD/roadmap missing

**TA Agent Implementation Fixes**:
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: TA MUST implement step-by-step, not all at once
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: TA MUST get user confirmation between each phase
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: TA MUST start with environment setup and simple rendering
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: TA MUST prove each part works before moving to next
- [ ] **ADD**: Clear ES6+ and TypeScript implementation standards
- [ ] **ADD**: Modern JavaScript best practices enforcement

**Over-Engineering Prevention**:
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: Agents MUST use simplest approach unless complexity required
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: No unnecessary files or content unless best practices require it
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: Start minimal, add complexity only when needed
- [ ] **ADD**: Simplicity rules to all agent guidelines

### **ðŸ”§ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty**
**Goal**: Improve user experience and workflow efficiency**

**File Structure Standardization**:
- [ ] **STANDARDIZE**: PRD naming convention (always just `prd`)
- [ ] **STANDARDIZE**: Documentation folder structure (`./bushi/docs`)
- [ ] **STANDARDIZE**: README location (always root folder)
- [ ] **CREATE**: Backlog file for future tasks/features
- [ ] **UPDATE**: All agents to use standardized file locations

**Chat Continuation Guidance**:
- [ ] **IMPLEMENT**: Chat continuation guidance feature
- [ ] **ADD**: New chat guidance prompt for users
- [ ] **ENFORCE**: Agents provide guidance when context limits approach
- [ ] **CREATE**: Seamless project continuation system

**Agent Rule Enforcement**:
- [ ] **IMPLEMENT**: Automatic rule enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] **ADD**: Pre-action validation hooks
- [ ] **CREATE**: Mandatory workflow step enforcement
- [ ] **BUILD**: Automatic blocking of non-compliant actions

### **ðŸŒŸ LOW PRIORITY - Low Impact, Low Difficulty**
**Goal**: Polish and optimization tasks**

**Documentation Polish**:
- [ ] **UPDATE**: Package.json version
- [ ] **PUBLISH**: New npm package
- [ ] **PUSH**: Code to GitHub
- [ ] **CREATE**: Release notes
- [ ] **TEST**: All agent commands with new constraints
- [ ] **VALIDATE**: Documentation consistency

## ðŸ”„ **FLEXIBILITY & ITERATION**
**This roadmap is flexible** and can include:
- **Technical decisions** (tech stack, architecture) as they're needed
- **Feature additions** based on user feedback
- **Priority changes** based on what users actually need
- **New epics** as we discover additional requirements

**The key is progress** - each phase should move us toward a working, valuable framework with high-impact improvements first.
