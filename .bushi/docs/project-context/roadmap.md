# Bushi Framework - Development Roadmap

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Fix Agent Behavioral Issues (Immediate)**
**Goal**: Fix fundamental workflow violations and improve user experience

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- [x] BA not asking about existing roadmap/PRD files before proceeding
- [x] BA adding timeframes without user input
- [x] BA creating MVP plans from vague ideas without proper context gathering
- [x] TA implementing without discussing tech stack or requesting user input
- [x] TA not expecting or requesting project documentation (PRD/roadmap)
- [x] TA not providing explanations of actions or requesting user feedback
- [x] TA working in isolation instead of suggesting other agents
- [x] Bushi-Limits file not being distributed to users (alwaysApply: true)
- [x] CLI not copying bushi-limits.mdc to user projects during init

**NEW CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED**:
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Bushi Start bypassed proper workflow, jumped straight to TA instead of BA - **FIXED**
- [x] **CRITICAL**: No documentation check before agent activation - **FIXED**
