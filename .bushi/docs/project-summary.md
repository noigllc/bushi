# Bushi Framework - Project Summary

## 🎯 **Core Vision**
**"Build Shit Fast"** - A comprehensive AI agent framework that helps users get things done efficiently across multiple domains.

## 🚀 **What Bushi Framework Is**
- **Suite of specialized AI agents** that help users reach their higher potential
- **Cross-context collaboration** - agents can read and build upon each other's work
- **Domain-agnostic design** - most agents work beyond just coding/programming
- **Structured AI interaction** - predictable, reliable AI assistance frameworks
- **Workflow establishment** - helping users create repeatable processes

## 🎯 **What Bushi Framework Is NOT**
- Life improvement or personal development tool
- Therapy or coaching replacement
- Generic AI chat interface
- Overly complex framework (like BMAD Method)

## 🏗️ **Core Architecture**

### **Agent System**
- **BA (Business Architect)**: Business strategy, planning, brainstorming (any domain)
- **DX (Design Experience)**: User experience, research, design (any domain)
- **TA (Technical Architect)**: Technical implementation, development workflows
- **GS (Growth Strategist)**: Growth, marketing, customer acquisition (any domain)
- **BO (Business Operations)**: Business operations, legal, financial (any domain)

### **Agent Interaction Protocol**
1. **Context Reading**: Agents read relevant docs before responding
2. **Active Guidance**: Agents ask questions and suggest next steps
3. **Documentation**: Agents document their outputs for others to use
4. **Clear Handoffs**: Defined transition points between agents

## 🔄 **User Workflow**
1. **Start with `/bushi-start`** - Agent discovery and selection
2. **Begin with appropriate agent** - Usually BA for new projects
3. **Agent collaboration** - Agents build upon each other's work
4. **Context sharing** - All agents have access to project context
5. **Iterative refinement** - Users can return to previous agents as needed

## 🎯 **Key Principles**
- **"Getting things done"** over endless planning
- **Cross-context awareness** between agents
- **User guidance** through questions and suggestions
- **Predictable AI interaction** patterns
- **Domain flexibility** for most agents

## 🚧 **Current Status**
- ✅ Basic CLI tool and package structure
- ✅ Cursor IDE integration
- ✅ Agent framework setup
- ✅ Agent behavior refinement (completed)
- ✅ Documentation structure (completed)
- ✅ Agent interaction protocols (defined)
- 🔄 Context sharing system (in progress)
- 🔄 User workflow validation (in progress)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Stabilize and publish** new version (immediate priority)
2. **Implement context sharing** system
3. **Test agent interactions** with real projects
4. **Build missing agents** (DX, TA, GS) with full capabilities
5. **Validate framework** with real users
