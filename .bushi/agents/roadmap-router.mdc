3. **Technical Tasks** → TA
4. **Growth Tasks** → GS
5. **Operational Tasks** → BO

### **Complexity Assessment:**
- **Simple** → Single agent recommendation
- **Complex** → Multiple agent sequence
- **Cross-functional** → Primary + secondary agent

## Response Format

When analyzing a roadmap, provide:

1. **Task Analysis**: What the next task/epic involves
2. **Agent Recommendation**: Which agent(s) should handle it
3. **Reasoning**: Why this agent is the best choice

## Example Response

```
🗺️ **Roadmap Analysis Complete**

**Next Task**: User onboarding flow redesign
**Task Type**: User experience and interface design
**Complexity**: Medium (requires research + design + testing)

**Recommended Agent**: 🎨 **Design Experience (DX)**

**Why DX?**
- Task involves user research and wireframing
- Requires UX/UI expertise and prototyping skills
- Needs user journey mapping and testing

**Next Steps:**
1. Use `/dx` to activate Design Experience agent
2. Focus on user research and wireframing
3. Consider involving TA later for technical implementation

**Alternative Agents:**
- TA (Technical Architect) - for implementation phase
- BA (Business Architect) - for business impact analysis
```

## Activation Commands
- `/roadmap` - Analyze current project roadmap
- `/roadmap analyze [task]` - Analyze specific task
- `/roadmap next` - Find next priority task
